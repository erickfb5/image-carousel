# Image Carousel
This is a simple HTML app that displays an image carousel with four images. The carousel includes two buttons: "Prev" and "Next" to navigate through the images.

### Installation
There is nothing to install, you just need to download the files and open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Usage
To use the app, click on the "Next" or "Prev" button to navigate through the images. 
The images will automatically slide every two seconds.
